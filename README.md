These are two projects I created during the AP-Computer Science ICS4U1 course.

## Skyforce Oversimplified

A remastery of a popular 2-D game, skyforce, where bullets are spawned periodically from a node and automatically chase after the player. The player must dodge and eliminate bullets with their ammo. Made with vanilla JavaFX in a 9-hour coding sprint in 2021 in grade 11.

## Bank Of Java

Final project for the course that showcased my understanding of Java, Object-Oriented Programming, and software development paradigms. This is a replica of a banking system consisting of users, accounts, and the interaction between different classes. Made with vanilla JavaFX in a 24-hour coding sprint in 2022 in grade 11. Collaborative project with Shay Kothari.
